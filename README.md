# teamprofilegenerator

TO RUN:
NPM I > node app.js

Project Description:

This is a simple teamprofilegenerator that is a command line input application that is run inside of node and generates a HTML that pulls up user information for different roles. 

Step 1: 
Enter team members name: This could be virtually anything.

Step 2: User will be prompted to place said team member in three catagories depending on the users role ( Engineer, Intern, and Manager).

Step 4: The user will be prompted for a ID, for the sake of formality I would go with a 1, 2, 3, 4 based on the role given, example is manager is 1. engineer 2, and intern 3.

Step 5: user will be prompted for email address. Enter the employees Email and hit enter to proceed.

Step 6: :Lastly it will ask for users github username, this could be anything. 

Lastly, view the HTML document inside of a browser and you will see all the team members information uploaded. ---- this is not working? member.username is not a function and I am not sure what function it's asking for?
